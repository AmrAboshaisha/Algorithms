    "<span style=\"color:blue\"> Porkland is a community of pigs who live in n houses lined up along one side of a long, straight street running east to west. Every house in Porkland was built from straw and bricks, but some houses were built with more bricks than others. One day, a wolf arrives in Porkland and all the pigs run inside their homes to hide. Unfortunately for the pigs, this wolf is extremely skilled at blowing down pig houses, aided by a strong wind already blowing from west to east. If the wolf blows in an easterly direction on a house containing b bricks, that house will fall down, along with every house east of it containing strictly fewer than b bricks. For every house in Porkland, the wolf wants to know its damage, i.e., the number of houses that would fall were he to blow on it in an easterly direction. </span>"
